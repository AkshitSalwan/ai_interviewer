# Voice Quality Updates (June 2025)

## Voice and Echo Improvements

We've made the following adjustments to improve the AI interviewer's voice quality and reduce echo:

### Female Voice Selection

- Improved voice selection algorithm to prioritize **Indian female voices** first
- Added specific check for voices like Veena, Aditi, Raveena, and Priya
- Added multiple female name indicators for better voice matching
- Implemented intelligent voice parameter tuning based on voice type
- Added language code detection for Indian voices (en-IN, hi-IN)
- Enhanced fallback hierarchy for consistent voice selection

### Echo Reduction

- Temporarily muted microphone during AI speech
- Extended silence after speech to 300ms before re-enabling transcription
- Improved echo detection window to 2000ms after speech
- Implemented sophisticated echo detection with:
  - Keyword matching
  - Phrase sequence detection
  - Match ratio calculation (% of words matching AI speech)
  - Short phrase special handling
- Optimized speech parameters by voice type:
  - Indian voices: Rate=0.9, Pitch=1.0, Volume=0.7
  - Other voices: Rate=0.93, Pitch=1.05, Volume=0.65
- Improved audio constraints during AI speech
- Added enhanced logging for voice selection and echo detection

### Voice Quality

- Fine-tuned voice parameters:
  - Slight pitch increase for a more natural female voice
  - Reduced volume to prevent speaker distortion
  - Optimized speech rate for better clarity and comprehension

### Testing Notes

If you still experience echo issues:
1. Use headphones when possible
2. Position the microphone away from speakers
3. Reduce system volume to minimize sound bleed
4. Ensure the room has some sound dampening (curtains, carpet, etc.)

These improvements should significantly enhance the AI interviewer's voice quality and reduce the chance of speech being re-recorded through the microphone.
