# Latest Updates: June 2025

## Implemented Improvements

- **PDF Handling**: Improved PDF file handling with browser-compatible text extraction and smart fallback mechanism
- **Enhanced AI Context**: Improved AI interviewer by properly including CV and job description context in all prompts
- **Fixed Naming Consistency**: Ensured consistent naming of the AI interviewer as "exchequer" throughout the application
- **Type Declarations**: Added proper TypeScript declarations for external library imports

## Usage Notes

### PDF File Upload

The application now fully supports PDF uploads for both CVs and job descriptions:

1. Upload any PDF file in the pre-interview setup screen
2. The system will attempt to extract text content using browser-compatible methods
3. This content will be used to inform the AI interviewer about the candidate and job requirements
4. If text extraction is limited, the system generates intelligent placeholders based on the file name
5. Users always have the option to manually enter or edit the extracted text

### AI Interviewer Improvements

The AI interviewer ("exchequer") now:
- References specific details from the candidate's CV during the interview
- Asks questions tailored to the job requirements
- Follows recruiter-provided guidance for interview focus areas
- Maintains a professional Indian tone consistent with the brand

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

- Add user accounts and persistent storage of interview records
- Implement role-based access for recruiters vs. candidates
- Create a dashboard for comparing multiple candidate interviews
- Enhance emotion analysis with more nuanced feedback
- Add support for multiple language interviews
